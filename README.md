# QUIZ TAKER!

## Description

A clean and easy way to take a quiz!

MVP: I as a user want a simple way to take a quiz

This is a simple test taker. Upgrade paths include making questions/answers and adding more categories. For the press of time, we were unable to add categories to the quiz taker. However the base code is avaliable in the files commented out.



## Installation

npm i
npm run
localhost:3001


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
